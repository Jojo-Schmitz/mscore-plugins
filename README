• notenames-as-lyrics.qml

  Not yet completed. It needs features that apparently were implemented
  in MuseScore 3.3 and later (which I did not upgrade to yet).

• notenames-as-stafftext.qml

  Write note names in SPN below each note/chord.
  Implemented by request from Mmike (Mario Splivalo) in IRC.

• show-ticks.qml

  Display an alert box with the ticks position of the currently selected
  elements. It uses both the MuseScore 3.3+ selected elements API (also
  in 3.2.3+dfsg2-8 in Debian) and the cursor range selection which is
  assumed to terminate one tick before the next segment begins.

Enjoy!
