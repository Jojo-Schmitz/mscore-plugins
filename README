• notenames-as-lyrics.qml

  Write note names in SPN below each note/chord. Here, as lyrics,
  with the lyrics verse corresponding to the voice number.
  Implemented by request from Mmike (Mario Splivalo) in IRC.

  ‣ https://musescore.org/en/project/name-notes

  Requires MuseScore 3.3 or Debian musescore3 (>= 3.2.3+dfsg2-9~)

• notenames-as-stafftext.qml

  Same as notenames-as-lyrics.qml (see above) but as staff text.
  Should work with MuseScore 3.2 as well but if you can, use the
  other implementation, as autoplace is tricky here…

• show-ticks.qml

  Display an alert box with the ticks position of the currently selected
  elements. It uses both the MuseScore 3.3+ selected elements API (also
  in 3.2.3+dfsg2-9 in Debian) and the cursor range selection which is
  assumed to terminate one tick before the next segment begins.

Enjoy!
