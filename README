• notenames-as-lyrics.qml

  Not yet completed. It needs features that apparently were implemented
  in MuseScore 3.3 and later (which I did not upgrade to yet).

• notenames-as-stafftext.qml

  Write note names in SPN below each note/chord.
  Implemented by request from Mmike (Mario Splivalo) in IRC.

Enjoy!
